  Study leader for the FIRIA project applied to two vital CERN facilities – a general purpose detector – Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and an accelerator - Proton Synchrotron (PS). My work on the FIRIA project is focused on fire risk assessment, fire modeling, and efficient parallel computing using high-performance computing. I am in charge of computing and fire hazard work packages.

  Apart from the work on the FIRIA project, I have also been involved in providing expert advice in refurbishment projects of multiple CERN buildings (industrial, office, and multipurpose) on applying the Swiss fire protection regulations of the AEAI.

  Furthermore, I supervised an MSc thesis and summer student projects focusing on ad hoc and standardized fire tests applied to CERN specific fuels and conditions.
